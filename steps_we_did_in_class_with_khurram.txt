Steps we did in class with Khurram
------------

Created/modified a method called "create" in the PicturesController
What did I do in there?
  @picture = Picture.new
Set the 3 parameters/attributes of the @picture
  @picture.title = params[:title]
  ...and the other 2 
SAVE!!!
  success = @picture.save
Once the picture is saved successfully, redirected to '/pictures'

We removed load_pictures...
In the index action where I need all the pictures, I load them from the DB (instead of hard coding them)
  @pictures = Picture.all
This returns a collection (Array) of pictures (not hashes)!

Change index.html.erb so that
picture[:title] 
turned into
picture.title
WHY? 
Because picture is not a hash, it's a Picture instance
